/*
Use Destructuring Assignment to Pass an Object as a Function's Parameters
const profileUpdate = (profileData) => {
  const { name, age, nationality, location } = profileData;

}

This effectively destructures the object sent into the function. This can also be done in-place:

const profileUpdate = ({ name, age, nationality, location }) => {

}
